### Simulation model FBA for urea cycle in human cells.

This is the submission for PS3 for CHEME 7770 course. It shows FBA on the urea cycle in human cells.

The model equations are implemented in the [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) programming language.

Required packaged are described in the ``Include.jl`` file.

#### Model results
1. The Stoichiometric Matrix is the uploaded excel file.
2. The uploaded screenshot shows the elemental balance.
3. The maximum urea flux was found out to be 1.24 mmol/gDW-hr.

The PS3_Solve.jl file is to be run to get the results.
